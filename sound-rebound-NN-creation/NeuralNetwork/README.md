# Goal is to use RNN network and make 

## FNN

I have a FNN to compare how well the RNN works

### basic RNN


## Future

### [Bi-direction RNN](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/bidirectional_lstm.py)
Bi-Directional RNN (LSTM). Apply a bi-directional LSTM to IMDB sentiment dataset classification task.

### [Dynamic RNN LSTM](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/dynamic_lstm.py)
Dynamic RNN (LSTM). Apply a dynamic LSTM to classify variable length text from IMDB dataset.
