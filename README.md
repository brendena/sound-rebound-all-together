sound-rebound-all-together is a combination of lots of smaller projects put together.

[sound-rebound-NN-creation](https://github.com/brendena/sound-rebound-NN-creation)

[sound-rebound-matrix-creator](https://github.com/brendena/sound-rebound-matrix-creator)

[sound-rebound-other-stuff](https://github.com/brendena/sound-rebound-other-stuff)

Each part had a destinct function that grouped together at the end.

## Goal

The goal was to create a system that would listen for specific sounds and alert the user when they sound happend.  I accomplished this using a array of machine learning techniques (see diagram bellow).
